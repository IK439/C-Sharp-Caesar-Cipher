# Caesar Cipher (C#)

## Description
This program is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** written in C#.  
It allows the user to **encrypt or decrypt a message** by shifting letters in the alphabet by a chosen number.

The program:
- Works with **uppercase and lowercase letters**

## How It Works

2. The user enters a shift key (number).
3. The user enters a message.
4. The program shifts each letter by the given key and displays the result.
